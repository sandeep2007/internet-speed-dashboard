# Internet Speed Dashboard Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install `speedtest-cli` for running internet speed tests.
   ```bash
   pip install speedtest-cli
   ```
3. Install `bash` if not already available (Linux systems typically have it pre-installed).

## Steps to Set Up the Project

### 1. Clone or Copy the Project
Copy the project files to your desired location. Ensure the following files are included:
- `dashboard.py`
- `install.sh`
- `requirements.txt`
- `internet-speed-dashboard.service`
- `speedtest.sh`

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment:
- On Linux/macOS:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### 4. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Set Up Cron Jobs
Run the `install.sh` script to set up the cron jobs:
```bash
bash install.sh
```
This will:
- Schedule the `speedtest.sh` script to run every 5 minutes.
- Schedule the `dashboard.py` script to start on every system reboot.

### 6. Start the Dashboard
To manually start the dashboard, run:
```bash
python dashboard.py
```

### 7. Access the Dashboard
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

### 8. Verify Cron Jobs
Check if the cron jobs are correctly set up:
```bash
crontab -l
```
You should see entries for:
- `*/5 * * * * ~/speedtest.sh`
- `@reboot python ~/dashboard.py`

## Additional Step

### Update the Service File
Ensure the `HOME` environment variable is correctly set in the `internet-speed-dashboard.service` file:
```plaintext
Environment="HOME=/home/pi"
```

## Notes
- Ensure the `speedtest.sh` and `dashboard.py` scripts have executable permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod +x speedtest.sh
  chmod +x dashboard.py
  ```
- The `internet_speed.log` file will store the internet speed test results.
- The dashboard will visualize the data from the log file.
